# Binary Classification of Top Quarks using Neural Networks and Big Data systems

In this project, I explored distributed big data processing techniques and deep learning architectures to classify top quarks in data from the Large Hadron Collider. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training neural networks for binary classification.

 Tools & Technologies: PySpark, Apache Hadoop, HandySpark, TensorFlow/Keras, MLPClassifier (Scikit-Learn)
