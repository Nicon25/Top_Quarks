<h1 style="text-align: center;">Binary Classification of Top Quarks using Neural Networks and Big Data Systems</h1>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The **Large Hadron Collider** produces a vast amount of high-energy physics data, requiring advanced techniques for storage, management, and analysis. Traditional centralized data processing systems struggle to handle this scale, making distributed Big Data frameworks such as **Apache Spark** and **Hadoop** preferable.

At the same time, neural networks bring significant power to identify patterns within complex datasets. In this project, I apply distributed computing and deep learning techniques for the binary classification of top quarks, using the ATLAS Top Tagging Open Data Set from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Models like **Multi-Layer Perceptron** and **Keras classifiers** make it possible to analyze data more accurately and uncover hidden patterns in particle physics.
